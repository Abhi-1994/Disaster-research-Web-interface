Designed a web map interface for the disaster research department using Exhibit 3.0. The web interface consisted of a map and a timeline. The map located the disasters and the timeline was used as a filter to display the research data. Preview of the website is available to be viewed, the actual interface is a hidden URL and University of Delaware Disaster Research Department has access to it.
